Stretch Questions

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? Establish a border around the element.


    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default:
	Block: <div>, <section>, <ol/ul/li>, <p>
	Inline: <span>, <a>, <img>


    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? 
The HTML elements are placed into a series of boxes. Inside is the content, then a padding around the content, then a border around the padding, then the margin around everything. Wrap box in div or section?
